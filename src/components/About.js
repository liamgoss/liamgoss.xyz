            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            I’m a Smittcamp Presidential Honors Scholar majoring in Computer Engineering at CSU, Fresno while also pursuing minors in cybersecurity and applied mathematics. Currently, I work as a freelance software developer with specialties in microcontrollers and blockchain technology. As I continue my education, I’m staying on top of new technologies and I’m known globally by blockchain developers of all experience levels. Upon graduation, I plan on entering the cybersecurity sector in the blockchain industry where I can use my knowledge of Solidity and vulnerability assessment to protect smart contracts deployed to the blockchain.
